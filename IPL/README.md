## Features

- **Dynamic Prediction:** Utilizes machine learning to provide dynamic predictions during live IPL matches.

- **Key Factors:** Analyzes factors such as batting team, bowling team, target, current score, overs, wickets, and match location to enhance prediction accuracy.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Allows users to input match details easily and receive instant predictions.
The prediction model utilizes a machine learning algorithm trained on historical IPL match data. The video demonstration showcases how each factor influences the prediction outcome. For example, the winning percentage increases when the match is played at the high-scoring ground in 'Sharjah' but decreases if played at 'Ahmedabad'. Additionally, factors like wickets, overs, and current score contribute to the overall prediction accuracy.
