# Loan Default Prediction with Random Forest

## Overview

This machine learning project focuses on predicting the probability of loan default using a Random Forest model. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about applicants, including features such as Education, Loan Term, Credit Score, Income, Interest Rate, Loan Amount, Months Employed, Loan Purpose, and Employment Type

## Features

- **Loan Default Prediction:** The project aims to predict the probability of loan default based on various features, including Education, Loan Term, Credit Score, Income, Interest Rate, Loan Amount, Months Employed, Loan Purpose, and Employment Type.
- **Random Forest Model:** The core of the project involves training a Random Forest model to make predictions on the likelihood of loan default.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** The project uses metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the Random Forest model.

## Dataset

- The dataset used for this project contains information about loan applicants, including the features mentioned above. The dataset can be found [here](link-to-dataset), and it is used for training and evaluating the machine learning model.
