# SQL Data Analysis and Power BI Dashboard

## Overview

This project focuses on data analysis using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and creating a comprehensive dashboard using Power BI. The analysis involves running SQL queries, saving query results, and leveraging the data to design and validate a Power BI dashboard.

## Project Structure

- **Data Analysis with SQL:**
  - Utilized Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for querying and analyzing the dataset.
  - Executed various SQL queries to extract meaningful insights and solve specific problems.
  - Stored query results in a documentation file for reference ([queries_results.doc](./queries_results.doc)).

- **Connecting Data to Power BI:**
  - Imported the SQL data into Power BI for further visualization and analysis.
  - Ensured a seamless connection between SQL Server and Power BI to maintain data integrity.

- **Power BI Dashboard Creation:**
  - Defined the key metrics and visualizations to be included in the final dashboard.
  - Planned the layout and design of the dashboard based on the desired outcomes.
  - Used Power BI features to create interactive and insightful visualizations.

## Steps Taken

1. **Planning:**
   - Outlined the objectives and requirements for the Power BI dashboard.
   - Defined key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics to be highlighted.

2. **SQL Data Analysis:**
   - Ran SQL queries to extract relevant data.
   - Documented the queries and their results for future reference.

3. **Data Transformation:**
   - Prepared the data for Power BI by addressing any necessary transformations or cleaning.

4. **Power BI Development:**
   - Designed and created the Power BI dashboard according to the initial plan.
   - Implemented visualizations and incorporated the SQL query results.

5. **Validation:**
   - Used the SQL query results to verify the accuracy of the data in the Power BI dashboard.
   - Ensured that the dashboard accurately reflected the intended insights.

## Repository Structure

- [Queries Results](/workspaces/projects/Sales_Report_SQL/PIZZA SALES SQL QUERIES.docx): Contains the SQL queries and their corresponding results.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the [Queries Results](/workspaces/projects/Sales_Report_SQL/PIZZA SALES SQL QUERIES.docx) file to review the SQL queries and results.
3. Open the Power BI file ([dashboard.pbix](/workspaces/projects/Sales_Report_SQL/salesdash.pbix)) to explore the final dashboard.

## Dependencies

- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
- Power BI Desktop

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of leveraging SQL data analysis in Microsoft SSMS to create a powerful and insightful Power BI dashboard. The structured approach, from planning to validation, ensures the accuracy and reliability of the final results. Feel free to explore the provided documentation and Power BI dashboard to gain insights from the analyzed data.
